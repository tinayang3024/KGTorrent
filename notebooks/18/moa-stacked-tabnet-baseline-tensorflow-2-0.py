    Group Normalization divides the channels into groups and computes
    within each group the mean and variance for normalization.
    Empirically, its accuracy is more stable than batch norm in a wide
    range of small batch sizes, if learning rate is adjusted linearly
    with batch sizes.
    Relation to Layer Normalization:
    If the number of groups is set to 1, then this operation becomes identical
    to Layer Normalization.
    Relation to Instance Normalization:
    If the number of groups is set to the
    input dimension (number of groups is equal
    to number of channels), then this operation becomes
    identical to Instance Normalization.
    Arguments
        groups: Integer, the number of groups for Group Normalization.
            Can be in the range [1, N] where N is the input dimension.
            The input dimension must be divisible by the number of groups.
        axis: Integer, the axis that should be normalized.
        epsilon: Small float added to variance to avoid dividing by zero.
        center: If True, add offset of `beta` to normalized tensor.
            If False, `beta` is ignored.
        scale: If True, multiply by `gamma`.
            If False, `gamma` is not used.
        beta_initializer: Initializer for the beta weight.
        gamma_initializer: Initializer for the gamma weight.
        beta_regularizer: Optional regularizer for the beta weight.
        gamma_regularizer: Optional regularizer for the gamma weight.
        beta_constraint: Optional constraint for the beta weight.
        gamma_constraint: Optional constraint for the gamma weight.
    Input shape
        Arbitrary. Use the keyword argument `input_shape`

        # Hyper Parameter Tuning (Excerpt from the paper)
        We consider datasets ranging from ∼10K to ∼10M training points, with varying degrees of fitting
        difficulty. TabNet obtains high performance for all with a few general principles on hyperparameter
        selection:
            - Most datasets yield the best results for Nsteps ∈ [3, 10]. Typically, larger datasets and
            more complex tasks require a larger Nsteps. A very high value of Nsteps may suffer from
            overfitting and yield poor generalization.
            - Adjustment of the values of Nd and Na is the most efficient way of obtaining a trade-off
            between performance and complexity. Nd = Na is a reasonable choice for most datasets. A
            very high value of Nd and Na may suffer from overfitting and yield poor generalization.
            - An optimal choice of γ can have a major role on the overall performance. Typically a larger
            Nsteps value favors for a larger γ.
            - A large batch size is beneficial for performance - if the memory constraints permit, as large
            as 1-10 % of the total training dataset size is suggested. The virtual batch size is typically
            much smaller than the batch size.
            - Initially large learning rate is important, which should be gradually decayed until convergence.
        Args:
            feature_columns: The Tensorflow feature columns for the dataset.
            feature_dim (N_a): Dimensionality of the hidden representation in feature
                transformation block. Each layer first maps the representation to a
                2*feature_dim-dimensional output and half of it is used to determine the
                nonlinearity of the GLU activation where the other half is used as an
                input to GLU, and eventually feature_dim-dimensional output is
                transferred to the next layer.
            output_dim (N_d): Dimensionality of the outputs of each decision step, which is
                later mapped to the final classification or regression output.
            num_features: The number of input features (i.e the number of columns for
                tabular data assuming each feature is represented with 1 dimension).
            num_decision_steps(N_steps): Number of sequential decision steps.
            relaxation_factor (gamma): Relaxation factor that promotes the reuse of each
                feature at different decision steps. When it is 1, a feature is enforced
                to be used only at one decision step and as it increases, more
                flexibility is provided to use a feature at multiple decision steps.
            sparsity_coefficient (lambda_sparse): Strength of the sparsity regularization.
                Sparsity may provide a favorable inductive bias for convergence to
                higher accuracy for some datasets where most of the input features are redundant.
            norm_type: Type of normalization to perform for the model. Can be either
                'batch' or 'group'. 'group' is the default.
            batch_momentum: Momentum in ghost batch normalization.
            virtual_batch_size: Virtual batch size in ghost batch normalization. The
                overall batch size should be an integer multiple of virtual_batch_size.
            num_groups: Number of groups used for group normalization.
            epsilon: A small number for numerical stability of the entropy calculations.

        # Hyper Parameter Tuning (Excerpt from the paper)
        We consider datasets ranging from ∼10K to ∼10M training points, with varying degrees of fitting
        difficulty. TabNet obtains high performance for all with a few general principles on hyperparameter
        selection:
            - Most datasets yield the best results for Nsteps ∈ [3, 10]. Typically, larger datasets and
            more complex tasks require a larger Nsteps. A very high value of Nsteps may suffer from
            overfitting and yield poor generalization.
            - Adjustment of the values of Nd and Na is the most efficient way of obtaining a trade-off
            between performance and complexity. Nd = Na is a reasonable choice for most datasets. A
            very high value of Nd and Na may suffer from overfitting and yield poor generalization.
            - An optimal choice of γ can have a major role on the overall performance. Typically a larger
            Nsteps value favors for a larger γ.
            - A large batch size is beneficial for performance - if the memory constraints permit, as large
            as 1-10 % of the total training dataset size is suggested. The virtual batch size is typically
            much smaller than the batch size.
            - Initially large learning rate is important, which should be gradually decayed until convergence.
        Args:
            feature_columns: The Tensorflow feature columns for the dataset.
            num_classes: Number of classes.
            feature_dim (N_a): Dimensionality of the hidden representation in feature
                transformation block. Each layer first maps the representation to a
                2*feature_dim-dimensional output and half of it is used to determine the
                nonlinearity of the GLU activation where the other half is used as an
                input to GLU, and eventually feature_dim-dimensional output is
                transferred to the next layer.
            output_dim (N_d): Dimensionality of the outputs of each decision step, which is
                later mapped to the final classification or regression output.
            num_features: The number of input features (i.e the number of columns for
                tabular data assuming each feature is represented with 1 dimension).
            num_decision_steps(N_steps): Number of sequential decision steps.
            relaxation_factor (gamma): Relaxation factor that promotes the reuse of each
                feature at different decision steps. When it is 1, a feature is enforced
                to be used only at one decision step and as it increases, more
                flexibility is provided to use a feature at multiple decision steps.
            sparsity_coefficient (lambda_sparse): Strength of the sparsity regularization.
                Sparsity may provide a favorable inductive bias for convergence to
                higher accuracy for some datasets where most of the input features are redundant.

                'group' or 'group'. 'group' is the default.
            batch_momentum: Momentum in ghost batch normalization.
            virtual_batch_size: Virtual batch size in ghost batch normalization. The
                overall batch size should be an integer multiple of virtual_batch_size.

        # Hyper Parameter Tuning (Excerpt from the paper)
        We consider datasets ranging from ∼10K to ∼10M training points, with varying degrees of fitting
        difficulty. TabNet obtains high performance for all with a few general principles on hyperparameter
        selection:
            - Most datasets yield the best results for Nsteps ∈ [3, 10]. Typically, larger datasets and
            more complex tasks require a larger Nsteps. A very high value of Nsteps may suffer from
            overfitting and yield poor generalization.
            - Adjustment of the values of Nd and Na is the most efficient way of obtaining a trade-off
            between performance and complexity. Nd = Na is a reasonable choice for most datasets. A
            very high value of Nd and Na may suffer from overfitting and yield poor generalization.
            - An optimal choice of γ can have a major role on the overall performance. Typically a larger
            Nsteps value favors for a larger γ.
            - A large batch size is beneficial for performance - if the memory constraints permit, as large
            as 1-10 % of the total training dataset size is suggested. The virtual batch size is typically
            much smaller than the batch size.
            - Initially large learning rate is important, which should be gradually decayed until convergence.
        Args:
            feature_columns: The Tensorflow feature columns for the dataset.
            num_classes: Number of classes.
            num_layers: Number of TabNets to stack together.
            feature_dim (N_a): Dimensionality of the hidden representation in feature
                transformation block. Each layer first maps the representation to a
                2*feature_dim-dimensional output and half of it is used to determine the
                nonlinearity of the GLU activation where the other half is used as an
                input to GLU, and eventually feature_dim-dimensional output is
                transferred to the next layer. Can be either a single int, or a list of
                integers. If a list, must be of same length as the number of layers.
            output_dim (N_d): Dimensionality of the outputs of each decision step, which is
                later mapped to the final classification or regression output.
                Can be either a single int, or a list of
                integers. If a list, must be of same length as the number of layers.
            num_features: The number of input features (i.e the number of columns for
                tabular data assuming each feature is represented with 1 dimension).
            num_decision_steps(N_steps): Number of sequential decision steps.
            relaxation_factor (gamma): Relaxation factor that promotes the reuse of each
                feature at different decision steps. When it is 1, a feature is enforced
                to be used only at one decision step and as it increases, more
                flexibility is provided to use a feature at multiple decision steps.
            sparsity_coefficient (lambda_sparse): Strength of the sparsity regularization.
                Sparsity may provide a favorable inductive bias for convergence to
                higher accuracy for some datasets where most of the input features are redundant.
            norm_type: Type of normalization to perform for the model. Can be either
                'batch' or 'group'. 'group' is the default.
            batch_momentum: Momentum in ghost batch normalization.
